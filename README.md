### About me:

* I'm a Software Engineer focusing on sharpening my Front-End skills! I've been coding for fun on and off for the past few years and decided to take a big step in my journey by joining the Front-End program at Turing School of Software & Design. I love to code! I'm passionate about bringing ideas to life that have a great UI/UX with accessability, responsiveness, and TDD.
